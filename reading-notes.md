## What is visual programming?

In computing, a **visual programming language** (VPL) is any programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.
Many VPLs (known as dataflow or diagrammatic programming) are based on the idea of "boxes and arrows", where boxes or other screen objects are treated as entities, connected by arrows, lines or arcs which represent relations.

## Classification

- Icon-based languages
- Form-based languages
- Diagram languages

## Relationship to dataflow programming

The original motivation for research into dataflow was the exploitation of massive parallelism.
The name dataflow comes from the conceptual notion that a program in a dataflow computer (by using only local memory and by executing instructions as soon as their operands become available)
is a directed graph and that data flows between instructions, along its arcs.
However the dataflow architecture didn't gain ground and what has been achieved is a hybrid with the Von Neumann architecture.

The 1990s saw a growth in the field of dataflow visual programming languages.

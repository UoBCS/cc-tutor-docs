# Assignment

You will write an article about your project that includes a literature review and a description of the preliminary project work. This article will be in the style of a scientific article such as, for example, the articles published in Communications of the ACM, or the late-breaking work sections of major conferences. Journals and conferences typically provide quite detailed instructions on how an article is to be presented. You will work with your supervisor to determine a suitable journal, or conference, format for your article. The format of the article, including the number of pages, will depend on the journal or conference chosen.

Your article will have to be carefully written so that it can be understood by the particular journal or conference readership. Again using Communications of the ACM as an example, an article suitable for this journal would need to be written for readers who have advanced degrees but who will be unlikely to be experts in the particular field. It is worth looking at a few Communications of the ACM articles as examples of what you should aim for. Some guidance on types of article can be found at: http://cacm.acm.org/system/assets/0000/6052/CACM_Author-Guidelines.pdf (Links to an external site.).

# Choice of style

The style to be used is the ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS) journal.
The motive of choosing this style is that in this journal compiler related papers are published.

# Guidelines

See material on Canvas.

- Remember signposts and flow

# Structure

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Problem analysis and proposed solution
- Software specification
